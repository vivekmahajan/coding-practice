PROBLEM STATEMENT
John has recently won a jackpot, but he doesn't need the money. He decided to share it with his friends instead. He knows how much money each of his friends has, and he will use this information to perform the distribution. While he still has money left, he will repeat the following steps:

Choose the poorest friend. If there are multiple poorest friends, choose one of them randomly.
Give 1 dollar to the chosen friend.

You are given an int jackpot, the number of dollars John has won, and a vector <int> money, where the i-th element is the number of dollars currently owned by the i-th friend. Return a vector <int> containing the same number of elements as money. The return value must contain the number of dollars owned by each friend after John has performed the above distribution, sorted in non-decreasing order.
