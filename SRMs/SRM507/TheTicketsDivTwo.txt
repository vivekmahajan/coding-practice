PROBLEM STATEMENT
John has two tickets for the basketball game - one for himself and one for a friend. However, he has n friends who want to go with him. He decides to use the following strategy to choose one of them. First, he tells his friends to form a straight single file line. Then, he repeats the following step until he has made a choice. If there is only one friend in line, John chooses him. Otherwise, he throws a standard six-sided die. If the number 4 is on top, he chooses the friend who is currently first in line. Otherwise, if the number is odd, the first friend in line must move to the end of the line, and if the number is even, the first friend in line must leave the line and go home. 

While the initial John's intention is to throw a die until some friend is chosen, in practice he gets tired quickly. If after k throws of a die he still hasn't chosen a friend, he prefers to stop the process and to choose the friend who is currently first in line.

You are given an int m, the 1-based index of a friend in the initial line. The index of the first friend is 1, and the index of the last friend is n. Return the probability that the m-th friend in the initial line is ultimately chosen by John.
